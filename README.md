- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chriscar152 or Chrisvedere
- 👀 I’m interested in racing, FPS, and open-world games and modding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to mod some of my favorite games. After I mod some games, I would want to create some of my own games one day.
- 💞️ I'm not sure about collaboration yet but once the time comes, we'll see.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can message me on instagram @chriscar_152 or email me (@TheSupercarFreak87@gmail.com).
